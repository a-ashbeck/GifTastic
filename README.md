# GifTastic
Homework 6 for the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp. This website allows users to
enter anything they like into a textbox, and then have that text turned into
a clickable button. Clicking the button will search giphy for (seemingly)
related gifs to the search terms and generate 10 gifs. Click the images to
start and stop the gif animations.
